    <h1>Ankle Pain Care</h1>

    <h2>Rest and Elevation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Avoid putting weight on the affected ankle as much as possible. This allows the tissues to heal.</li>
        <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Keep your ankle elevated above heart level to reduce swelling. Use a pillow or cushion to support it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply a cold pack or ice wrapped in a cloth to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. This helps reduce inflammation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Compression</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a compression bandage or brace to help reduce swelling and provide support to the ankle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Anti-Inflammatory Medications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Follow recommended dosage guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ankle Exercises and Stretches</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once the acute pain subsides, gentle exercises and stretches can help improve strength and flexibility. Consult a physical therapist for guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supportive Footwear</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wear comfortable shoes with good arch support to help alleviate pressure on the ankle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid High-Impact Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stay away from activities that put excessive strain on the ankle, such as running or jumping, until the pain subsides.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Assistive Devices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If needed, consider using crutches or a walking aid to take weight off the affected ankle while it heals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Seek Professional Medical Advice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms (like numbness or tingling), consult a healthcare professional.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physical Therapy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A physical therapist can create a customized exercise and stretching plan to help rehabilitate the ankle and prevent future injuries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bracing or Splinting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In some cases, a brace or splint may be recommended to provide additional support during the healing process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>RICE Protocol</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation are the cornerstone treatments for many types of acute injuries, including ankle pain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Tight Clothing or Jewelry</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tight clothing or jewelry around the ankle can impede blood flow and aggravate the pain. Opt for loose-fitting clothing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gradual Return to Activity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once the pain has significantly improved, gradually reintroduce activities to prevent re-injury.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weight Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining a healthy weight reduces excess stress on the ankles.</li>
    </ul>
