    <h1>Heart Health Tips</h1>

    <h2>Balanced Diet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your diet. Limit saturated and trans fats, as well as sodium and added sugars.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Aim for a body mass index (BMI) within the healthy range. Losing excess weight can reduce the strain on your heart.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Limit Alcohol Intake</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Manage Stress</h2>
