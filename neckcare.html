    <h1>Neck Care Tips</h1>

    <h2>Maintain Good Posture:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your head aligned with your spine while sitting, standing, and walking. Avoid slouching or hunching over.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exercise and Stretch Regularly:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Engage in neck exercises and stretches to improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension. This can include gentle neck tilts, rotations, and side stretches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Prolonged Screen Time:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Take breaks from looking down at screens to prevent straining your neck. If you work on a computer, ensure the monitor is at eye level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Ergonomic Devices:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjust your computer monitor, chair, and desk to maintain a neutral neck position while working. Use a comfortable, supportive chair.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sleep on a Supportive Mattress and Pillow:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a mattress and pillow that provide adequate support for your neck. Avoid using overly high or stiff pillows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Carrying Heavy Bags on One Shoulder:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you need to carry a bag, use a backpack with wide, padded straps to evenly distribute weight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Apply Heat or Cold Packs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a hot or cold compress on the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. This can help reduce pain and inflammation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stay Hydrated:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper hydration supports overall muscle and joint health, including the neck.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Excessive Strain:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be mindful of activities that put excessive strain on your neck, such as carrying heavy objects or performing strenuous exercises without proper form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Stress Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Engage in relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce muscle tension and stress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Tight Clothing or Jewelry:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tight clothing or jewelry around the neck can restrict blood flow and aggravate discomfort. Opt for loose-fitting options.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Seek Professional Help:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you experience severe or persistent neck pain, or if it's accompanied by other concerning symptoms like numbness or tingling, consult a healthcare professional.</li>
    </ul>
