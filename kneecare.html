    <h1>Knee Care Tips</h1>

    <h2>Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Excess weight can put extra strain on your knees. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent knee problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stay Active</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Engage in regular exercise to strengthen the muscles around your knees. Activities like walking, swimming, and cycling can be beneficial.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Warm-Up Before Exercise</h2>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Stretch Regularly</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stretching helps improve flexibility and range of motion in your knees. Focus on stretches for the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Proper Form</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When participating in sports or exercise, use proper techniques and form to reduce the risk of knee injuries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Overuse</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't overexert yourself with high-impact activities. Alternate between different types of exercises to give your knees a break.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wear Appropriate Footwear</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose shoes that provide good support and cushioning. This helps distribute pressure evenly across your feet and knees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strengthen the Muscles Around the Knee</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Use Knee Pads or Braces</h2>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Avoid Kneeling on Hard Surfaces</h2>

        <li>If possible, use knee pads or cushioning when you need to kneel down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Listen to Your Body</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you experience pain or discomfort in your knees, take a break and rest. Pushing through pain can lead to further injury.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Manage Existing Knee Conditions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have a pre-existing knee condition or injury, follow your healthcare provider's advice for treatment and management.</li>

        <li>If you have a history of knee problems, choose low-impact activities like swimming or cycling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper hydration supports overall joint health, including the knees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maintain a Balanced Diet</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Use Assistive Devices if Necessary</h2>
